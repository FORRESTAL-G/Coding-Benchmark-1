# 3D Molecular Visualization Challenge

A comprehensive coding benchmark for AI assistants and coding agents.

## Purpose

This challenge is designed to test the capabilities of AI coding assistants, agents, and vibe-coding IDEs across multiple dimensions of software development. Use this benchmark to evaluate how well your AI tools can handle:

- Multi-component architecture design
- Scientific computing accuracy

- Data validation and testing
- Browser-based application development

## Challenge Overview

**Task**: Build a complete 3D molecular visualization system that parses chemical data, validates molecular geometry, and renders interactive visualizations in the browser.

**Target Users**: Developers working with AI assistants (Claude, GPT-4, Copilot, etc.) or AI-powered development environments  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced  
**Time Estimate**: 1-2 weeks with AI assistance  
**Tech Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript, Three.js, HTML5/CSS3
